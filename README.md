# 100 Days Of ML Code

Starting today, 29 August 2018, I pledge to participate in and contribute to **100DaysOfMLCode** challenge by this wizard [Siraj Raval](https://github.com/llSourcell/100_Days_of_ML_Code), though it's a little late to start. 

## Overview

In this challenge, I will study and code about Data Science, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning. But, I want to focus on Data Science and Machine Learning since I've just started my Deep Learning journey recently, just want to be more solid on Machine Learning before moving deeper to Deep Learning.

## Projects List

For this **100DaysOfMLCode**, here I have listed some topics and projects, but not limited to:

* [DrivenData Competition](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/7/pump-it-up-data-mining-the-water-table/page/25/)
* Any **Kaggle** Competition and Tutorials
* __Predictive Maintenance of Aircarft Engine using Machine Learning__, this is my thesis!
* Anomaly Detection on Surveillance Videos using C3D
* Reading [Python Deep Learning Book](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/python-deep-learning)

I will focus on the first 2 projects. Furthermore, I will read some articles on medium or other platforms to keep updated of some DS/ML/DL.
