# Neural_Network_From_Scratch

Code for building neural network from scratch

## Libraries to Use

- Numpy

<!-- TODO: add HOW TO USE section -->

## Architecture Notes

In this project, I will demonstrate how to build neural network along with
forward-propagation and backward-propagation (backprop). For simplicity, the
activation function used here is **sigmoid** activation function. The
architecture of the networks are:

- We will build 3 layers neural network: 1 input layer, 2 hidden layer, 1 output
  layer
- Both hidden layers will have 3 nodes
- The output layer will only have 1 nodes since we will use sigmoid to do binary classification
