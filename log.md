## Day 1 - 30 Auguts, 2018

__Process:__

- TensorFlow review from medium article: [TensorFlow : No idea where to begin? â€“ Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/tensorflow-no-idea-where-to-begin-b7b981d7321e)
- Code simple TensorFlow
- Configure TensorFlow on Mac

__Achievement:__

- UnderstandTensorFlow workflows concept-Computational Graph
- Hands-on simple TensorFlow

__Lesson to Learn:__

- Need to manage time better
- Prepare the environment before code


## Day 2 - 31 Auguts, 2018

__Process:__

- TensorFlow review from DataCamp article: [TensorFlow Tutorial For Beginners (article) - DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/tensorflow-tutorial?utm_source=adwords_ppc)
- Hands-on the tutorials in Notebook

__Achievement:__

- Understand image data characteristic in ndarray format
- Load image data from .ppm format using UDF load_data()
- Exploratory image data

__Lesson to Learn:__

- Some dependencies aren't installed yet, so need to make sure that everything
  is prepared
- thoughts: what is tf.ConfigProto for?


## Day 3 - 1 September, 2018

__Process:__

- Build neural network model using TensorFlow
- Read chapter 1 of Python Deep Learning Book on Pakct

__Achievement:__

- Code neural network model using TensorFlow of Belgian Traffic Signs problem
- More thorough understanding about machine learning concept as Deep Learning
  foundation

__Lesson to Learn:__

- Need to keep focus while doing the challenge
- Not so understand some Deep Learning and TensorFlow terms


## Day 4 - 2 September, 2018

__Process:__

- Code basic classification using TensorFlow
- Read chapter 2 of Python Deep Learning Book on Packt

__Achievement:__

- Successfully implement tensorflow tutorial for fashion-mnist image
  classification

__Lesson to Learn:__

- Still need to configure the backend for deep learning environment


## Day 5 - 3 September, 2018

__Process:__

- Start project **drivendata competition**
- Configure GUI in a docker container

__Achievement:__

- Importing _Pump it Up: Data Mining the Water Table_ dataset
- Successfully configured GUI in a docker container: *by showing scatterplot of matplotlib*

__Lesson to Learn:__

- Getting used to unix environment


## Day 6 - 4 September, 2018

__Process:__

- Continue to do exploratory analysis on Pump it Up Dataset
- Configure OpenCV and its GUI on Docker Container using XQuartz

__Achievement:__

- Classified categorical and numerical features
- Plot histogram of one example of categorical feature using Seaborn
- Succesfully configure OpenCV and connect it to local display server

__Lesson to Learn:__

- Need to handle missing values, especially in categorical features first


## Day 7 - 5 September, 2018

__Process:__

- Explore further on dataset _Pump it Up: Data Mining the Water Table_

__Achievement:__

- Get deep insights on both categorical and numerical features that may useful
  for feature engineering

__Lesson to Learn:__

- From different option of handling missing value, choose an appropriate one
- Need to check if there are sparse class in categorical feature that can be
  fuse with other class in feature engineering


## Day 8 - 6 September, 2018

__Process:__

- Reading a paper about learning spatiotemporal features using C3D

__Achievement:__

- Understood the difference between C3D and common 2D CNN

__Lesson to Learn:__

- Didn't have enough time to continue reading the paper, need a smart way to
  read all the paper points in limited time


## Day 9 - 7 September, 2018

__Process:__

- Try out tensorflow inside Docker Container
- Review how tensorflow works

__Achievement:__

- Built docker container environment specifically for TensorFlow running on
  Jupyter Notebook
- Reviewed how tensorflow works

__Lesson to Learn:__

- Build more docker container for next projects environment
